# Alexander Kampf -- Developer

## Who am I?
I am a computer science student with a preference for maths and functional
programming. I programm since the start of my studies, mostly solving
mathematical problems and automating  my personal workfow. More recently I
started application development. I am really passionate about the programming
languages I use, because I love well designed and readable code which recently
drove me into funcional programming.
