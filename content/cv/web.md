## Alexander Kampf -- Developer

### Who am I?
I am a computer science student with a preference for maths and functional
programming. I programm since the start of my studies, mostly solving
mathematical problems and automating  my personal workfow. More recently I
started application development. I am really passionate about the programming
languages I use, because I love well designed and readable code which recently
drove me into funcional programming.

### Non Profit

Together with other members of the student association, we help freshmen to get
started with their studies. We organize orientation events. Other than that I
also try to get other students into Linux, the operating system and the entire
free software philosophy around it. I organize events in which I help others
installing Linux and start learning how to use it.
